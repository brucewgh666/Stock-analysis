The advantages of refactoring code is optimize the design and structure of orginal code,but still perform the same function. Also another advantage of refactoring code is let this code can fit in more scenario.
When this refactor code apply to the original VBA script,one pros is having less processing time. It indicate it is more efficient, the program go faster.When we process extreme large database similar to this.It will cause less time to get exact same result.
